# Basic Nginx configuration to serve a Single Page Application (SPA) like React

server {
    # Listen on port 80 inside the container
    listen 80;
    # Define server name (optional, localhost is fine for this context)
    server_name localhost;

    # Root directory where the static assets are located
    root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    # Default file to serve
    index  index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        # Try to serve the requested file directly ($uri),
        # then try it as a directory ($uri/),
        # otherwise, fall back to serving /index.html.
        # This fallback is crucial for client-side routing in SPAs.
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Optional: Add custom error pages, gzip compression, cache headers, etc.
    # Example gzip configuration (uncomment if needed):
    # gzip on;
    # gzip_vary on;
    # gzip_proxied any;
    # gzip_comp_level 6;
    # gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
